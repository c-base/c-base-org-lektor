## AI Enthusiasts Meetup @ c-base ‚Äî Celebrating 30 Years of the Space Station

Level: Intermediate ‚Äì Advanced

This month we‚Äôre plugging into something special: c-base is turning 30, and we‚Äôll be marking the occasion with a walkthrough of the new station AI ‚Äî a living, occasionally glitchy, and sarcastic system built to embody the lore of the crashed space station.

Alongside that, it‚Äôs business as usual:
a community-driven AI enthusiasts gathering focused on real collaboration, real projects, and real code. Whether you‚Äôre hacking together something wild, tinkering with local LLMs, or just stuck knee-deep in the weeds, this is your orbit to explore, experiment, and conspire with fellow travelers.

Bring:
- your ideas
- your code
- your laptop or tablet
- and most importantly, your willingness to collaborate

Got something cool to show off? Wrestling with a bug you can‚Äôt squash? Want to lead a lightning talk or workshop? The seminar room is yours for deeper dives.

The event is free, but drinks are 3‚Ç¨ (cash only) to thank c-base for keeping the space station‚Äôs lights (and gravity generators) on.

üó£Ô∏è The event will be held in English and ggwave.<br>
No pitches. No takers. Just humans + machines + collaboration.

Let‚Äôs celebrate 30 years of c-base, fire up the station AI, and build some cool stuff together.
