BEAT is an acronym for "Berlin Elektronisches Audio TÃ¼fteln", or in English: "Berlin Electronic Audio Tinkering", and is an event about exactly that.

The event is split into 2 parts:

### Presentations

- Participants can present something at the front stage.
- You can share your laptop screen or present hardware via our overhead camera to the canvas.
- The presentations will be recorded and streamed.
- The type of presentation is not restricted: A demonstration of a setup, a showcase of a product, a talk about a project, etc.

### Social part

- Here you can socialize and exchange ideas with everyone.
- This part is also meant for getting out your own gear.
- There is the possibility of jamming with others via our mixer and our music system.
- We also supply mixers, headphone splitters, and small speakers, such that you can have another small station in the corner with others.

We will post a schedule including what will be presented this time asap. If you would like to join and present something, please reach out to us! There is still room in the program.
